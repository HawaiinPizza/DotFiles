I think I may have psychopathy. I know I shouldn't self diagnosis but like I feel fucking insane. What can I say?

Actually no. I don't know if i have boldness. When I'm with strangers I cower like a bitch, but when I'm with people I don't give a fuck.

Actually no I ain't got psychopathy.  I don't know what I have. I'll just list my symptoms:

- Poor impulse control. I a lot of food because I'm bored/hungry.
- Need to be like: I have this almost paradoxical view that I need to be liked, but when people do, I treat them like shit.
- Jealous: I get jealous of other people very quickly. Like when I saw @Sammy's girlfriend, @AlexW, I got super salty in the inside, and I didn't talk to her much.
- Sleep: I often need 11 hours of sleep, and even then I don't feel rested.
- Manipulative: I lied to my sister, telling I'm a Muslim, to make sure she doesn't accidentally slip I'm agnostic. I do this to everyone in my fucking life.
- Antisocial: I don't like going out with people. I just see less and less value each time. Like at @SammyBirthday or the fact that I deliberately avoided @Phonies0818
- Loser: I'm generally a loser. I don't have any real achievements in my life. 


But honestly, I learned not to care about this. My mental condition is not something to care about. No matter how much I try to fight it, it'll always be a part of me. I'll always have a hole in my heart, my family will fall apart, my friends will drift off. There's nothing I can do about it, save mind-controlling everybody.

This is my fate, my destiny. I can do nothing to fight against God and his divine path. But I can either accept it and be happy, or fight and be sad that I will lose the fight. Usually, I will fight in losing battles, like arm wrestling @Abdulhadi, but this time I am gonna fold them.
